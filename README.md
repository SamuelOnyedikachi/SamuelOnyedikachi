👋 Hello, I'm Samuel Onyedikachi

 Enthusiastic about building intuitive and impactful digital experiences through modern software development.
I craft dynamic, responsive, and scalable web interfaces that merge performance with precision. With a solid foundation in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, I specialize in building rich user experiences using React.js and Tailwind CSS. My workflow is powered by Git and GitHub, ensuring clean version control and collaboration. I’m currently expanding my skillset with TypeScript and Node.js to deepen my frontend capabilities and bridge into full-stack development. Every line of code I write aims to create software that’s fast, intuitive, and built to last.
